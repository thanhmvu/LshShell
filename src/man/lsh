.SH NAME
lsh - Lafayette Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsh 
[options] [file]

.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsh
is a mini shell for Linux. It can create, monitor, and report processes in Linux. It also creates pipelines, and works with stdin, stdout, stderr, PATH, and environment variables.
.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.SH "SHELL GRAMMAR"
.SS "Simple commands"
A \fIsimple command\fP is a sequence of optional variable assignments
followed by \fBblank\fP-separated words and redirections, and
terminated by a \fIcontrol operator\fP.  The first word
specifies the command to be executed, and is passed as argument zero.
The remaining words are passed as arguments to the invoked command.
.PP
The return value of a \fIsimple command\fP is its exit status, or
128+\fIn\^\fP if the command is terminated by signal
.IR n .
.SS Pipelines
.PP
A \fIpipeline\fP is a sequence of one or more commands separated by
the character
.BR | .
The format for a pipeline is:
.RS
.PP
[\fBtime\fP [\fB\-p\fP]] [ ! ] \fIcommand\fP [ \fB|\fP \fIcommand2\fP ... ]
.RE
.PP
The standard output of
.I command
is connected via a pipe to the standard input of
.IR command2 .
.PP
Each command in a pipeline is executed as a separate process (i.e., in a
subshell).

.SH PARAMETERS
A
.I parameter
is an entity that stores values.
It can be a
.IR name ,
a number, or one of the special characters listed below under
.BR "Special Parameters" .
A
.I variable
is a parameter denoted by a
.IR name .
A variable has a \fIvalue\fP and zero or more \fIattributes\fP.
Attributes are assigned using the
.B declare
builtin command (see
.B declare
below in
.SM
.BR "SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS" ).
.PP
A parameter is set if it has been assigned a value.  The null string is
a valid value.  Once a variable is set, it may be unset only by using
the
.B unset
builtin command (see
.SM
.B SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
below).
.PP
A
.I variable
may be assigned to by a statement of the form
.RS
.PP
\fIname\fP=[\fIvalue\fP]
.RE
.PP
If
.I value
is not given, the variable is assigned the null string.  All
.I values
undergo tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion,
command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote
removal (see
.SM
.B EXPANSION
below).  If the variable has its
.B integer
attribute set, then
.I value
is evaluated as an arithmetic expression even if the $((...)) expansion is
not used (see
.B "Arithmetic Expansion"
below).

.sp .5
.PD 0

.TP
\fBbg\fP [\fIjobspec\fP]
Resume each suspended job \fIjobspec\fP in the background, as if it
had been started with
.BR & .

.TP
\fBecho\fP [\fIarg\fP ...]
Output the \fIarg\fPs, separated by spaces, followed by a newline.
The return status is 0 unless a write error occurs.
Any environment variable will be looked up and replaced with their value. 
For example, 
.B echo $PATH 
prints out the value of the PATH environment variable. 

.TP
\fBfg\fP [\fIjobspec\fP]
Resume
.I jobspec
in the foreground, and make it the current job.

.TP
\fBjobs\fP 
List all jobs currently running in the background.

.TP
\fBstats\fP [\fB\-uspvialc\fP]
.PD
Enable process statistics on each external command executed. The options have the following
meanings:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B \-u
Enable the display of the cpu time spent in user mode.
.TP
.B \-s
Enable the display of the cpu time spent in system/kernel mode.
.TP
.B \-p
Enable the display of the hard page faults.
.TP
.B \-v
Enable the display of the voluntary context switches.
.TP
.B \-i
Enable the display of  the involuntary context switches.
.TP
.B \-a
Enable the display of all of the above options.
.TP
.B \-l
List of stats that are enabled.
.TP
.B \-c
Clear all the enabled stats. Shell runs external commands like the default shell.
.PD
.PP
Multiple flags can be listed after one dash, e.g. -us instead of -u -s, as well as a series of single flags.
.PP
