PROJECT DOCUMENT

Huy Nguyen â€“ Thanh Vu

1.	Obstacles we overcame
	* Familiarizing with C.  
	This is our very first project in C (and a major one no less). There were many features we take for granted in Java (e.g., splitting string) that we ended up struggling to re-implement in C. Huy was particularly startled when he realized C has no built-in Boolean type. Thanh spent half of the project time attempting to find nice, clean way to initialize and return (arrays of) arrays of string from functions.
	
	* Theory to practice. 
	Concurrency is particularly confusing, and while we knew the basic concepts 


2.	Things we learned
	* Technical notes
		
		You can have bug in makefile.
		
		Sometime malloc is the only "nice" way to work with arrays of strings. Do not forget to free memory afterwards.
		
		When code piping in C, it is critical for the parent to close all file descriptors after the children dup them.


3. Project enhancements
	* Additional features
		
		Support sequence of commands, e.g., command1 ; command2 ; command3 ; ...
		
		Support navigation between directories with 'cd'
